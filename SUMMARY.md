**FSOD: A High-Diverse Few-Shot Object Detection Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 66502 images with 182591 labeled objects belonging to 800 different classes including *cake*, *wheelchair*, *orange*, and other: *window blind*, *lipstick*, *houseplant*, *guitar*, *salad*, *mug*, *goose*, *sandal*, *van*, *shower cap*, *worm*, *shelf*, *shirt*, *hedgehog*, *pillow*, *doll*, *backpack*, *cat*, *swan*, *wall clock*, *butterfly*, *camper*, *countertop*, *dagger*, *flag*, and 772 more.

Images in the FSOD dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (52350 images) and *test* (14152 images). Additionally, every image contains information about its ***sequence***. Every label contain information about its ***supercategory***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool.
